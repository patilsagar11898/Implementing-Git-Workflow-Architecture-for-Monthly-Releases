Implementing Git Workflow Architecture for Monthly Releases
Case Study: Implementing Git Workflow Architecture for Monthly Releases

Problem Statement:
Zendriix Softwares is facing challenges in managing their product releases, which are scheduled for the 25th of every month. As a DevOps Architect, you are tasked with suggesting a Git Workflow Architecture to streamline the release process and ensure timely deliveries.

Proposed Solution: Git Workflow Architecture

To address Zendriix Softwares' release management issues, I propose the following Git Workflow Architecture:

1. Main Branch: This branch will serve as the primary integration branch. It will always contain the latest stable version of the software.

2. Feature Branches: Developers will create feature branches off the main branch to work on new features or fixes. Once the feature is completed, it will be merged back into the main branch through a pull request.

3. Release Branches: A release branch will be created from the main branch at the beginning of each release cycle (e.g., on the 20th of the month). This branch will undergo testing and bug fixes before being deployed to production on the 25th.

4. Hotfix Branches: If critical issues are discovered in the current production version, hotfix branches will be created from the main branch. Once the fix is implemented, it will be merged into both the main branch and the current release branch.

Simulation:

I will simulate this workflow by creating pseudo code files and branches on GitHub. Here's an outline of the steps:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Initialize the repository with a README file.
3. Create branches for main, feature, release, and hotfix.
4. Add pseudo code files to represent features and fixes.
5. Simulate merges and pull requests to demonstrate the workflow.

GitHub Repository Link:

I've implemented the proposed Git Workflow Architecture in a GitHub repository. You can access it (https://github.com/patilsagar11898/Implementing-Git-Workflow-Architecture-for-Monthly-Releases).

Conclusion:

By implementing this Git Workflow Architecture, Zendriix Softwares can achieve better control over their release cycles, ensuring timely and stable product deliveries. Continuous integration and testing practices can further enhance the reliability of the release process.
